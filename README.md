#  C++ Projects – Logic, AI, and Image Processing

These C++ projects were developed during my **second semester at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Democritus University of Thrace**.  
They represent my early exploration of **game AI** and **computer vision**, combining algorithmic logic with hands-on coding in C++.

##  Tic-Tac-Toe (with AI)

A terminal-based **Tic-Tac-Toe game** where the player competes against an AI opponent with increasing levels of difficulty.

###  Features:
- **3 Difficulty Levels**:
  - *Easy* → AI makes random moves
  - *Medium* → AI blocks your winning moves
  - *Hard* → AI uses **Minimax Algorithm** (unbeatable)
- Play as X or O, with input like `A1`, `C3`, etc.
- Turn-based gameplay with clean terminal interface

📌 **What I Learned:**
- Game logic and board management
- AI decision-making using trees and recursion
- Minimax algorithm and perfect strategy implementation

📁 Files:
- `tic_tac_toe.cpp`

##  SmartSelfie (with OpenCV)

A **webcam-based image processing app** that captures a selfie, detects faces, and applies filters using **OpenCV**.

###  Features:
- Live webcam preview window
- Press `SPACE` to capture a photo
- Face detection using **Haar Cascade Classifier**
- Saves three images:
  - Original photo
  - Face-detected version (with rectangles)
  - Grayscale & blurred version

📌 **What I Learned:**
- Real-time camera feed handling
- Face detection in C++ with OpenCV
- Applying image filters (blur, grayscale)
- Saving image files programmatically

📁 Files:
- `smart_selfie.cpp`
- Cascade XML file for face detection

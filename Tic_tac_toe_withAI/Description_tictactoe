🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe (with AI) – Terminal C++ Game
This was one of my favorite mini-projects from uni — a clean, console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where you can play against the computer.

I implemented three difficulty levels:

🟢 Easy: the computer picks random moves

🟡 Medium: it tries to block your winning moves

🔴 Hard: uses the Minimax algorithm to play optimally (basically unbeatable!)

You can choose whether to go first or second, and input moves using formats like A1, C2, etc.
It was the first time I built a full decision-making system — and it taught me how AI logic trees really work behind the scenes.

📌 What I learned

Game logic and board state management

Turn-based input handling

Writing clean, modular C++ code

Implementing a recursive AI algorithm (Minimax)

🛠️ Built using Visual Studio on Windows.
